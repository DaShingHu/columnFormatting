In solving the wave equation, three unknowns were encountered (A fourth was later added). 
These unknowns are called the quantum nmbers, and describe different properties of 
the electron. 

- Electron configuration is a bookkeeping system that tracks all the 
  electrons of an atom. 

- The Bohr-Rutherford diagram is a really poor way to keep track of 
  all the electorns.
- The form it takes is nL^# of Electrons
- n is the Energy Level
- This is called the Principal Quantum Number 
- In Quantum, there are four ways to eep track of an electron. 
- The principal Quantum Number keeps track of the energy level the 
  electron is in.


- For example, Carbon has six electrons. According to Bohr-Rutherford, 
  there are two shells.
- Here, instead, it has 2 in the first energy level, with four in the second energy level.

- Phosphorous has three energy levels. 
  - The first energy level has 2
  - The second energy level has 8
  - The third energy level has 5



- L is called your "orbital quantum number"
- Orbital coming from the word orbit. In the early quantum theory,
  electrons orbited an electron, which was two dimensional.
- Orbital is a region in space where there is a high probability of
  finding an electron or electrons.
- So the orbital qunatum number describes the shape 
  the electrons behave (The shapes).
- We usually describe this in terms of shapes 



-  There are 
"Remember, electrons are constantly moving. Because they are 
constantly moving, we can't ddescribe their exact location, we can only
say that they're probably located in this area"

"I'm going to tell you- Oh, there's uhh three shapes, a fourth one, but for
grade 11's sake, I'll telly ou what the three shapes are.

The three shapes that electrons behave are

The S-orbital,  because S stands for spherical
And I'll tell you where the S orbitals are. 

Okay, S- Orbital. Here it is. See this periodic table you have? 

Electrons can spin, Ms is the spin number.
There are two numbers, positive one half and negative one half.
So electrons can spin on their axes. 

So the electron configuration for hydrogen is simply 1S^1

In Hydrogen, the S-orbital, the electron would move
in a spherical shape. Orbitals are 3D

If I were to use the wave equation, and if we were to solwe 
the wave equation, input all the information about yhrdorgen, this is the solution
that you will see.
Each of these dots reperesent a solution to the wave equation.

What it means is that each of these dots represent a high probability of finding
a hydrogen electron. 

So in a S-orbital, the shape given by the most likely points would be a sphere, tehrefore
the S-orbital.

Let's look at Lithium. 

Lithimu is also the electrons in the S.

The only difference between Lithium and Hydrogen is that Lithimu has a bigger orbital.

And how many electorns does a Lithium atom have? 3. 
Where are the first two? In the first energy level.
And the third one is somewhere in the outer energy level.

Alright, next, you see the third box? Group 3 to gorup 8 of the representative. 

These guys are the P-orbitals  (Propellor).
So when it moves, it moves in a propeller shape.

A propeller shape looks like an infinity sign.

With the propeller one, you have 3 propellers all meeting at the centre, 
creating a 3 dimensional shape. All there of them intersect at their centres.

And the last oril, you see the transition metals? these guys are the
D-orbitals. The "D". D stands for "Dumbell". As each orbit can hold two, and there are 5 
similar orbitals, it can hold a total of 10 electrons.

One more rule, one more thing.
I wonder if I should show you how to derive L.
OKay, this is FYI.
L is determined by n - 1, where n is energy level. 

Don't worry about Ml, I won't show you how to derive Ml.

So that means, who are the atoms in the first energy level?
Hydrogen and Helium.
And what are their n-levels? (0? I think.)
Oh, yea. So anyways, hydrogen and helium are in the first row,
so that means that their N-values are n = 1.
What are the L values of Hydrogen and helium?
So it's 0.
So if it's 0, what is the shape of the orbital? (Spheriacl)
Spherical. So when we wirte the electorn configuration fo rHydrogen, it's 1S^1.
For Helium, it's 1S^2.

The reason why it's still an S is because the L value is still 0. 

Let's write one for Lithium.

Li has a total of 3 electorns.

So you have to fill, whenever you are filling, yo ualways fill from 
tehe inner energy level from the lowest to the highest.

Li: 1S^2 2S^1

The 2 tells us that it's in the second energy level ad that it moves in a
spherical shape.

OKay, after Lithium is Boron.

Boron is 
1S^2 2S^2 2P^1

Okay, so let's practice some more.

Let's look at Phosphorous.

Phosphorous has 15 electrons, right?
So in order to get Phosphorous, let's start filling with the lowest.

1S^2 is the lowest.
So that brings us to atomic number two.
1S^2 2S^2, but now wer'e in P, becaues we're on Boron.
1S^2 2S^2 2P^6 

After 2 P^6, we're down to ther third row, which is 3S^2

1S^2 2S^2 2P^6 3S^2.

And then wee're moving onto 1S^2 2S^2 2P^6 3S^2 3P^3

How about Neon? One more?
1S^2 2S^2 2P^6


Make sense? Okay.

I'll show you how to the shorthand notation.

Okay. 

Let's look at Neon. 

Ne: 1S^2 2S^2 2P^6

Let's look at Phosphorous.
P: 1S^2 2S^2 2P^6 3S^2 3P^3

This is called the "Long form." This is where we start from the first energy level up to the
outer energy level.

OKay, alright.

Neon ends at 2P^6

Whenever you write a shortform you always start wit ha noble gas.

Remember how many electrons a P can hold? 6. So yo uwnill never, ever, find a 
neon compound will ever form, becaues there's no room to form a bond. 
It's full.

We can rewrite Phosphorous using a shorthand notation.

To write a shorthand notation, we start with the noble gas.

If you loo kat P: [1S^2 2S^2 2P^6] 3S^2 3P^3, it looks like neon,
so the shorthand notation is P:[Ne] 3S^2 3P^3.
"


So you always start with a noble gas to replace the first part, and then you write the remainder.

"
OKay, so now we're moving onto the Ds. The Ds are the tranisition memtals. Okay? 
Before we do this, hold on. Do you guys rememebr the Lewis dot diagram 

Phosphorous. How many valence electrons are in a Phoshporous electron? 
5.
Valence electors mean that the electors are in the outer energy level. Your third one.
And there are two plus three is 5. (3S^2 + 3P^3)


Now, let's start with the D. Notice Potassium.
Okay, using shorthand notation, what's the electron configuration for 
Potassium, using shorthand?
K:[Ar] 4S^1
(Argon is the nobel gas prior to K, and there is 1 electron in the outermost shell, which is S shaped.).

After Potassium is Calcium.
So therefore, you're going to start with argon, and potassium will be
Ca:[Ar] 4S^2.

Now, I want to move onto Scandium, which is Sc.

Once again, we start with Argon.
Sc: [Ar]4S^2 3D^1
Alright, osn ow when you do hte order filling, you must fill teh 4S first before you do the 3D. The reason 
why is beacuse the 3d  has higher potential energy.

Scandium: How many valence electrons does Scandium have? 

2.

Wel the definition of valence electorns is the electrons located
in the outemrost energy level. The one that is the furthest away from
the nucleus. 

Your D is always start at the third. 
Remember the Ds fall one behind the S.

You won't learn the F until next year.

The F falls two behind the S. 

Fe: [Ar] 4S^2 3D^6


Okay, let me ask you another one.

Let's look at, say, Copper.


Cu: [Ar] 4S^2 3D^9


Fe has 26 electrons.

How many of those 26 electrons behave or move in spherical shape? (8)

H + He
Li + Be
Na + Mg
K + Ca
8. 

How many are the P-Orbital? (12).
12.

B + C + N + O + F + Ne
Al + Si + P + S + Cl + Ar.

So far, so 8 + 12 is 20.

So we have 6 left.
So how many are left in the Ds? (6)
6. 
Sc + Ti + V + Cr + Mn + Fe

Lewis dot diagram for Fe has 2 

What do yo uthink the valency for Fe is, or the ionic charge is ? 
+2 or +3. 

All things want to be stable.
So all things in stabel want to become stable.
For an atom, there are three ways it can become stable.

1) (The most stable) To be fully filled (Noble gas), like He: 1S^2
IT's in the first energy level, teher's no rom. Because the S can only occupy 
two electrons, and it's already full.
Same thing as Neon, Ne: 1S^2 2P^6, and as you can see the P has 6, which is full.

Did ou know that this thing exissts in life? XeF4
Xeon can form a compound. Xeon Tetraflouride. 

Because Xeon has orbitals tahta re empty. So there's room for bonding to occur.

Okay, so I told you the first most stabel electron arangem.nt



2) The second most is either all empty or all full. That's how yo uwant it.
Either empty or full, you can't have antyhing else


3) The third is half filled. 

So these are your three stable electron arrangements of an atom. 
Either you want the energy level to be fully filled, some of the orbitals either full or empty,
or if you can't achieve that, we'd prefer for them to be half filled.


OKay, so let's look at Fe. So how do you think you can get +2?

THe electrons that are being lost are those thar are furthest away from the nucleus.

It would lose from the 4S^2, empting the S, which is stable.

+3 is when you lose 2 from 4S, and 1 from 3D, which is also very stable.

"

So in order to predcit valency, you can just ese how many it would have to lose to get either "Half" full,
"Half empty", or to "Empty out fully", or to "Fill fully"


"Okay, se let's look at Arsenic.

As: [Ar]4S^2 3D^10 4P^3.

Okay, so if I were to ask you to draw the lewis dot diagram for Aresinc, what would it look like?
5 on the outside. 

3 from the 44P and 2 from the 4S.

Okay, make sense?

So when you look for valence electrons, you look for the highest N value.

Remeber, n is your energy levels?

Valencies for Arsenic? 
+3 (4P loses 3 from 4P^3), or +5 (4P loses 3 from 4P^3 and 4S^2 loses 2)

+5 is the more common.
Because then tehre won't be a fourth shell at all, it'll fall back.

So that means that the third one is fully filled. 

Remeber, we want hte energy levels filled. 

So let's do another one.
Nitrogen.

No, wait, let's do... Sure, we can do Nitrogen.

N: 1S^2 2S^2 2P^3.

Valencies for Nitrogen are +3, +5, -3.

1S^2 2S^2 2P^3 loses 3 from 2P^3 to be +3

1S^2 2S^2 2P^3 loses 3 from 2P^3 and 2 from 2S^2 to be + 5

1S^2 2S^2 2P^3 fills up 2P to get -3 

Outo f these one,s which one do yo uthink are most common?

which ones are the most stable? The most common?

It's definitely not +3, because if you do, you need ot fully fill the escond energy level.
It's -3 because then if yo uhave 2P^6, then it's second energy shell is full.

It's a lot easier to lose 3 than to gain 5.

Can yo uguys practice wirting electron configurations for the first 54 elements?


Monday, I'll show you how to write the energy lvel diagram.

So I'll show you how to convert this to energy level diagarm.
And then after that, we'll move onto trends.

"




The Bohr Model
- Lowest Energy Orbit -> n = 1
- The farther from the nucleus the greater the energy
- Electrons want to be in the lowest energy orbits possible
- The distance between the nucleus and the orbits depends on the number of 
  protons in the nucleus and so is different for each element.

Electron Filling
 -  The maximum number of electrons in any orbit can be calculated using 2n^2
- Exception: THe last orbit (valence) can only hold a maximum of 8 electrons (Octet rule)

n 	     Symbol Orbit   Max number of electorns
1	     1	    	    2
2	     2		    8
3	     3		    18
4	     4		    32



	     
The Two Quantum Numbers

1. The Principle Qantum Number  (n)
   - Indicates the  energy an electron has 
   - Tells us which energy level the electron is in 
   - IT can have values of:
     n = 1, 2, 3, 4....
   - The higher the n-value, the greater the energy
   - Correspond to Bohr's shells

2. The Orbital Quantum Number (L) (An area in which there is a high possibility of an electron existing

   - Indicates the shape of the orbital
   - It can have values of:
     	L: 0, 1, 2, 3... ( n - 1)


    n-Value   Possible L-Values		Electrons		Name Of Orbital
    1	      0	       			2			S-Orbital
    2	      0,1			8 (2, 6)		S-Orbital, P-Orbital
    3	      0, 1, 2			18(2, 6, 10)		S-Orbital, P-Orbital, D-Orbital	
    4	      0, 1, 2, 3		32 (2x2, 2x6, 2x10)     2xS-Orbital, 2xP-Orbital, 2xD-Orbital
