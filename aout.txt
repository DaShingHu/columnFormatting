In  solving the wave equation, three unknowns were     were  to  use the wave equation, and if we were to     filling,  yo  ualways  fill from tehe inner energy     outermost   shell,   which   is  S  shaped.).After
encountered  (A  fourth  was  later  added). These     solwe   the   wave   equation,   input   all   the     level  from  the  lowest  to  the highest.Li: 1S^2     Potassium  is  Calcium.So  therefore, you're going
unknowns   are  called  the  quantum  nmbers,  and     information   about   yhrdorgen,   this   is   the     2S^1The  2 tells us that it's in the second energy     to  start with argon, and potassium will beCa:[Ar]
describe  different  properties of the electron. -     solutionthat  you  will  see.Each  of  these  dots     level  ad  that it moves in aspherical shape.OKay,     4S^2.Now,  I  want to move onto Scandium, which is
Electron  configuration  is  a  bookkeeping system     reperesent  a  solution  to the wave equation.What     after   Lithium   is   Boron.Boron  is  1S^2  2S^2     Sc.Once  again,  we  start with Argon.Sc: [Ar]4S^2
that  tracks  all  the electrons of an atom. - The     it  means  is  that each of these dots represent a     2P^1Okay,  so  let's practice some more.Let's look     3D^1Alright,   osn   ow  when  you  do  hte  order
Bohr-Rutherford  diagram  is  a really poor way to     high  probability  of  findinga hydrogen electron.     at   Phosphorous.Phosphorous   has  15  electrons,     filling,  you must fill teh 4S first before you do
keep  track  of  all  the  electorns.- The form it     So  in  a  S-orbital,  the shape given by the most     right?So  in order to get Phosphorous, let's start     the  3D.  The  reason  why  is  beacuse the 3d has
takes  is  nL^#  of  Electrons-  n  is  the Energy     likely  points  would  be  a  sphere, tehreforethe     filling  with  the  lowest.1S^2  is  the lowest.So     higher   potential   energy.Scandium:   How   many
Level-   This  is  called  the  Principal  Quantum     S-orbital.Let's  look  at Lithium. Lithimu is also     that  brings  us  to  atomic number two.1S^2 2S^2,     valence  electrons  does  Scandium have? 2.Wel the
Number  -  In  Quantum, there are four ways to eep     the   electrons   in  the  S.The  only  difference     but  now  wer'e  in P, becaues we're on Boron.1S^2     definition  of  valence electorns is the electrons
track  of  an  electron.  -  The principal Quantum     between  Lithium  and Hydrogen is that Lithimu has     2S^2  2P^6  After  2 P^6, we're down to ther third     locatedin  the  outemrost  energy  level.  The one
Number   keeps  track  of  the  energy  level  the     a  bigger  orbital.And  how  many electorns does a     row,  which  is  3S^21S^2  2S^2 2P^6 3S^2.And then     that  is the furthest away fromthe nucleus. Your D
electron  is  in.-  For  example,  Carbon  has six     Lithium  atom have? 3. Where are the first two? In     wee're  moving  onto  1S^2  2S^2 2P^6 3S^2 3P^3How     is  always  start  at  the  third. Remember the Ds
electrons.  According  to  Bohr-Rutherford,  there     the  first  energy  level.And  the  third  one  is     about  Neon?  One  more?1S^2  2S^2 2P^6Make sense?     fall  one behind the S.You won't learn the F until
are  two  shells.-  Here, instead, it has 2 in the     somewhere   in  the  outer  energy  level.Alright,     Okay.I'll   show   you   how   to   the  shorthand     next  year.The  F falls two behind the S. Fe: [Ar]
first  energy  level,  with  four  in  the  second     next,  you  see  the third box? Group 3 to gorup 8     notation.Okay.  Let's  look at Neon. Ne: 1S^2 2S^2     4S^2  3D^6Okay,  let  me ask you another one.Let's
energy   level.-   Phosphorous  has  three  energy     of   the   representative.   These  guys  are  the     2P^6Let's  look  at  Phosphorous.P: 1S^2 2S^2 2P^6     look  at,  say, Copper.Cu: [Ar] 4S^2 3D^9Fe has 26
levels.  -  The  first  energy  level  has 2 - The     P-orbitals  (Propellor).So when it moves, it moves     3S^2  3P^3This  is called the "Long form." This is     electrons.How  many  of  those 26 electrons behave
second  energy  level  has  8  -  The third energy     in  a propeller shape.A propeller shape looks like     where  we  start from the first energy level up to     or  move  in spherical shape? (8)H + HeLi + BeNa +
level  has  5-  L  is called your "orbital quantum     an  infinity sign.With the propeller one, you have     theouter  energy  level.OKay, alright.Neon ends at     MgK  +  Ca8. How many are the P-Orbital? (12).12.B

the  early  quantum  theory,  electrons orbited an     a   3   dimensional   shape.  All  there  of  them     start   wit   ha   noble   gas.Remember  how  many     far,  so  8  +  12  is 20.So we have 6 left.So how
electron,  which  was two dimensional.- Orbital is     intersect  at their centres.And the last oril, you     electrons  a  P  can  hold? 6. So yo uwnill never,     many  are left in the Ds? (6)6. Sc + Ti + V + Cr +

probability  of finding an electron or electrons.-     theD-orbitals.  The  "D".  D stands for "Dumbell".     becaues  there's  no  room  to  form  a bond. It's     uthink  the valency for Fe is, or the ionic charge
So  the orbital qunatum number describes the shape     As  each  orbit  can  hold  two,  and  there are 5     full.We  can rewrite Phosphorous using a shorthand     is  ?  +2  or  +3. All things want to be stable.So
the  electrons  behave  (The  shapes).- We usually     similar  orbitals,  it  can  hold  a  total  of 10     notation.To  write  a shorthand notation, we start     all  things in stabel want to become stable.For an
describe  this  in  terms  of  shapes  - There are     electrons.One  more  rule, one more thing.I wonder     with  the  noble  gas.If you loo kat P: [1S^2 2S^2     atom,   there   are   three  ways  it  can  become

Because  they  are  constantly  moving,  we  can't     is  FYI.L  is  determined  by  n  -  1, where n is     shorthand  notation  is  P:[Ne]  3S^2 3P^3."So you     (Noble  gas),  like  He:  1S^2IT's  in  the  first

going  to  tell you- Oh, there's uhh three shapes,     atoms  in  the  first  energy  level?Hydrogen  and     remainder."OKay,  so now we're moving onto the Ds.     full.Same  thing  as  Neon,  Ne: 1S^2 2P^6, and as
